This script was written in Python 2.7 for my wireless design lab final project. The script initializes a random binary signal which is then modulated using the FSK pattern. Noise is added to the signal to show the strengths of the modulation scheme, and then the signal is demodulated and the error rate is counted.

To run this script, the following modules are required: numpy, pylab, and scipy.
